# GameCubeISOOrganizer
Take a folder of GameCube ISOs and format them for use on a modified Wii.

This takes ISOs in a folder and creates sub-folders with the name of the ISO and renames the ISO to "game.iso" to work with a modified Wii. The files are copied, not moved, to avoid loss of data.

## Instructions:

Run the executable, navigate INTO the folder where the ISOs are located, and then click choose.

## To-Do List:

1. Add Windows/Linux support
2. Find possible matches for game IDs to append to the folder names.
